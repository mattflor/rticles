Text based on PLOS sample manuscript and the LaTeX guidelines at [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex)

You may remove the comment markers to include these in the PDF.

Guidelines for all manuscripts are listed in the author instructions. [Read the instructions.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines)

# FIGURES AND TABLES {-}

Please include tables/figure captions directly after the paragraph where they are first cited in the text.

DO NOT INCLUDE GRAPHICS IN YOUR MANUSCRIPT

- Figures should be uploaded separately from your manuscript file.
- Figures generated using LaTeX should be extracted and removed from the PDF before submission.
- Figures containing multiple panels/subfigures must be combined into one image file before submission.

For figure citations, please use "Fig" instead of "Figure".
See [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures) for PLOS figure guidelines.

Tables should be cell-based and may not contain:

- tabs/spacing/line breaks within cells to alter layout or alignment
- vertically-merged cells (no tabular environments within tabular environments, do not use `\multirow`)
- colors, shading, or graphic objects

See [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/tables](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/tables) for table guidelines.

# Introduction {-}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit [@Dirac1953888] amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur eget porta erat. Morbi consectetur est vel gravida pretium. Suspendisse ut dui eu ante cursus gravida non sed sem. Nullam Eq (\ref{eq:schemeP}) sapien tellus, commodo id velit id, eleifend volutpat quam. Phasellus mauris velit, dapibus finibus elementum vel, pulvinar non tellus.

# Materials and Methods{-}

## Figures {-}

<!-- For figure citations, please use "Fig" instead of "Figure". -->
Do not include figures in the manuscript PDF.
Submit figures as separate TIFF or EPS files.
Figures with multiple panels (subfigures) should be uploaded as a single file.
Do not upload each panel/subfigure separately.

PLOS does not accept vector EPS figures generated in \LaTeX. 
PLOS accepts only TIFFs or EPS created in standard software, such as Adobe Illustrator, InkScape, PyMol, MatLab, or SAS.

<!-- Place figure captions after the first paragraph in which they are cited. -->
\begin{figure}[!h]
\caption{{\bf Bold the figure title.}
Figure Caption Proin rutrum vel massa non gravida. Quisque tempor sem et dignissim rutrum. A: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. B: Consectetur adipiscing elit.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

### Convert LaTeX-generated EPS figures to TIFF: {-}

1. Compile the LaTeX files as PDF.
1. Open PDF in Photoshop, GIMP, or another graphics software that enables TIFF.
1. Crop out the figure and export as TIFF.

    For more information about figures, [read the figure guidelines.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures)

## Tables {-}

* Tables must be cell based.

* PLOS does not accept vertically merged cells in tables. Certain LaTeX table formatting techniques, such as using `\multirow` or containing a tabular environment within another tabular environment, will result in vertically merged cells and should therefore be avoided.

* Tables cannot contain graphics or colors.

* Do not use `\hline` for new lines within a cell. This will result in data being split between two different shaded rows. Instead, allow text to wrap within a cell.


    For more information about tables, [read the table guidelines.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/tables)


<!-- Results and Discussion can be combined. -->

# PLOS Template

For your convenience, PLOS provides a template for LaTeX submissions.
Download the template.

Use this template to help format your article for our production process.
You can add packages to this template but please do not remove any that are already included.

The zip also contains the `plos2015.bst` BibTeX style sheet.
Use this file to specify the formatting of your BibTeX file as it will ensure that your references are generated in the correct format.
If your submission does not follow the template format, your manuscript may be sent back to you for corrections.

## LaTeX Version

You are required to use LaTeX2e. [Download the latest version.](http://www.latex-project.org/)


## How to Submit

For your initial submission, upload the PDF as your manuscript file, containing your manuscript text, figure legends, tables, and references.
Do not include figures in your PDF; they should be uploaded as separate files.

If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to upload your LaTeX source file.
If your manuscript .tex is separated into several `.tex` files, combine these into a single, cohesive `.tex` file before submission.
Make sure to update your PDF file with the most recent version of your manuscript.

As stated in the PLOS template, your reference information should be included in your `.tex` file (not submitted separately as `.bib` or `.bbl`).

## Formatting Tips

* Use the [PLOS template.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=SyJ3/plos-latex-template.zip)

* Do not track changes in your final tex file. PLOS recommends the use of latexdiff to track changes in the manuscript PDF during review, as this will help to maintain a clean tex file. Download [latexdiff.](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff?lang=en)

* Your manuscript source file should not call on external files (do not use `\input` or `\externaldocument`).

* Include all portions of equations within the math environment in order to ensure it is correctly rendered. 

* For the author byline, use the formatting and symbols included in the template.

* Use Unicode characters instead of LaTeX commands when possible (e.g., type `é` instead of `\'{e}`).

* Follow the instructions in the template regarding the placement of table and figure legends.

* Follow the instructions in the template for proper formatting of supporting information legends and citations.

* Elements that exceed the width of the text column must be included in an “adjustwidth” environment to display properly. [See the template for more information.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=SyJ3/plos-latex-template.zip)


## Equations

### Display equations

* Include entire equation in one math environment.

* Include terminal punctuation within the math environment.

* Add line breaks in long equations (so that they will fit our column width).

### In-line equations

* If any part of the equation or phrase includes a character only available in math mode, then include the entire equation/phrase in one math environment. 


    Please refrain from using math mode for non-math content, such as chemical formulas.
    For example, please use `CO\textsubscript{2}` instead of `$\mathrm{CO}^2$`

* Do not include commas or other normal (text) punctuation in the math environment, if possible.
